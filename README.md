# Rabbit Ark

> Scalable downloader that downloads asynchronously

## Description

This program is inspired by [YouTube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) and [Hitomi Downloader](https://github.com/KurtBestor/Hitomi-Downloader)

The download is processed using the [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess) module.
